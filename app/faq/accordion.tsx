          Yes, you can certainly combine picks from not only different teams but also different games. The only restriction when it comes to the picks is the following: An entry cannot have all players from the same team in a given match.

          All entries must be placed 5 minutes before the scheduled start time of the respective games. If the start times of the players in your entries vary, then the entry must be placed 5 minutes prior to the earliest scheduled start time. If you miss this deadline, donâ€™t worry. For we have plenty of in-play pick options offered during timeouts and inning breaks. For entries placed during the innings break, the deadline is 10 minutes after the end of the first innings(so act quick!)

          >
          In case your pick does not get a chance to bat or bowl, your pick will get pushed/go null. In other words that pick will be eliminated from your entry and your payout will drop down to the next lowest payout option, i.e. your initial 4 pick entry will now be treated as a 3 pick entry. For 2-pick entries, the user will be refunded his original entry amount and the bet will be canceled.
